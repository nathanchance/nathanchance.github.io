      <description>I have been contracting for the Linux Foundation for two years now, going onto the third, and it dawned on me that I have never done a retrospective or yearly report. This is useful for looking back on the year&amp;rsquo;s worth of accomplishments, both to understand how much I have evolved and to look for areas that I would like to improve upon going forward. I have struggled with imposter syndrome for as long as I have been involved with the kernel community, so looking back to give credit where credit is due for particular solutions is a good way to try and combat that.</description>

scripts/Makefile.extrawarn: Do not disable clang&#39;s -Wformat-zero-length (v1) x86/build: Move &#39;-mindirect-branch-cs-prefix&#39; out of GCC-only block (v1) Stable backport requests: It is important to make sure that the stable trees are as free from issues as possible, as those are the trees that devices and users use; for example, Android and Chrome OS regularly merge from stable, so if there is a problem that will impact those trees that we fixed in mainline, it should be backported.</description>

      <description>As a Linux kernel developer, I will often need to build and boot new kernels to hunt down issues or test new functionality for regressions. While it is possible to manually install these kernels on machines, it is easiest to use the distribution&amp;rsquo;s package manager, as the kernel does not need to be built on the machine it is being installed on. With .deb and .rpm-based systems, it is easy to build a kernel package within the kernel source itself, using the bindeb-pkg and binrpm-pkg targets respectively.</description>

Linux kernel patches Miscellaneous improvements: These are series or patches that do not really fit into any of the other categories I typically use with my reports.
Allow CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_DWARF5=y + CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y (v1) tools/resolve_btfids: Do not print any commands when building silently (v1) -Wenum-conversion: This warning occurs when one enumerated type is implicitly converted to another enumerated type, which is typically a bug, although it might not actually be a problem in practice if the used enum has the same value as the intended enum (which is the case here).</description>

      <title>Reducing an LTO Linux kernel bug with cvise</title>

      <description>My co-maintainer Nick Desaulniers wrote a great post about taking a several thousand line C file that exposed a compiler bug down to 12 lines with creduce. I thought I would do the same thing with a bug that only happens with link time optimization (LTO) in the Linux kernel, which is a bit of a different beast. Hopefully this post can help others reduce their own bugs and think about the best way to triage a bug.</description>

      <description>This was a bit of a shorter month for me, as I took some vacation at the beginning of the month to recouperate and meet half of my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s extended family and friends for the first time. Thankfully, the rest of the ClangBuiltLinux team was able to keep everything churning along in my absence and I was able to be super productive the rest of the month once I returned.</description>

      <description>Linux kernel patches tools: compiler-gcc.h: Guard error attribute use with __has_attribute (v1): The minimum version of GCC was raised to 5.1, which helped simplify a lot of code but caused issues for older versions of clang. This helps resolve it.
Harden clang against unknown flag options (v2): A follow up.
ptp: ocp: Avoid operator precedence warning in ptp_ocp_summary_show() (v1, v2): An interesting warning around operator precedence, which will not be an issue in practice but now that Linus has decreed that warnings are unacceptable, it is important to clean them up!</description>

      <description>Linux kernel patches [PATCH] dmaengine: idxd: Remove unused status variable in irq_process_work_list(): Not a clang specific warning but it impacts builds where I use -Werror, as kernel builds should be as warning clean as possible.
[PATCH] ASoC: Intel: boards: Fix CONFIG_SND_SOC_SDW_MOCKUP select: Not a clang specific warning but Kconfig warnings such as this can potentially be build errors later due to incorrect dependency selection so it is important to fix them when they pop up.</description>

      <description>Linux kernel patches [PATCH] Hexagon: Export raw I/O routines for modules: Hexagon is a digital signal processor architecture by Qualcomm, which is a little special in terms of the Linux kernel because it is the only architecture that does not have a GCC backend so LLVM has to be used to build it, meaning that it is important to keep it building. This patch fixes an issue with allmodconfig, which enables us to build a wide variety of code and verify the compiler is able to handle all of it.</description>

      <description>Linux kernel patches ANDROID: sched: Gate sched_stat tracepoint exports on CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS: One of those instances where a tangential change in the Android trees broke our continuous integration. Our CI tests some 32-bit ARM configurations because certain Android OEMs care about them but these configs are not tested by the actual Android team, meaning we find breakage that they do not.
[PATCH net-next] net: ks8851: Make ks8851_read_selftest() return void: clang implemented GCC&amp;rsquo;s -Wunused-but-set-variable and this instance was found by Intel&amp;rsquo;s kernel test robot.</description>

      <description>This month felt longer than others but I feel like that was because I was a lot more spread out in the work that I was doing. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in, shall we?
Linux kernel patches / backports [PATCH] fbmem: Correct position of &#39;__maybe_unused&#39; in proc_fb_seq_ops: A common mistake people make is splitting &amp;ldquo;struct &amp;rdquo; with an attribute, in this case &amp;ldquo;__maybe_unused&amp;rdquo;, which clang warns about while GCC does not. This causes a warning in all of our builds.</description>

      <description>Another month down! Feels like I just wrote the March 2021 post&amp;hellip; but I suppose that is what happens when your project moves super quickly :)
Linux kernel patches [PATCH] ACPI / CPPC: Replace cppc_attr with kobj_attribute: I discovered this issue as part of my testing of Sami Tolvanen&amp;rsquo;s Control Flow Integrity series (more on that below). There are probably many more of these lurking because this pattern is hard to spot without runtime testing.</description>

      <description>Another month, another post about the work that I have done as a kernel/compiler developer! One of the highlights this month is that I got LLVM commit access so I can merge my own patches into LLVM, which I did twice so far.
Linux kernel patches powerpc/fadump: Mark fadump_calculate_reserve_size as __init: LLVM 13 switched over to the New Pass Manager (NPM), which has impacted some inlining decisions, which in turn exposed some bugs in section annotations.</description>

      <description>As some of you may or may not know by now, I am now employed by the Linux Foundation to help improve Linux security. The primary way that I am doing that is through the work I do for ClangBuiltLinux, of which I am an official maintainer.
Linux kernel patches First and foremost, I am a Linux kernel developer, meaning that I love sending kernel patches. Getting familiar with git send-email and the standard Linux kernel workflow can be difficult but now that I am used to it, I find other things cumbersome.</description>

One caveat before I start: there is great official documentation for git bisect, from which I have taken quite a bit of information.</description>

      <description>I have been a big fan of Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 as I need Windows for school but I am so used to the command line for remoting into my server and automating various tasks locally. For those of you who do not know, WSL 2 uses a Linux kernel under the hood (which I customize here) and all of the various distributions that you can run are basically containers on top of it.</description>

      <description>Recently, I stumbled upon a talk that Alistair Delva, a Google engineer, gave at the 2018 Linux Plumbers Conference around Cuttlefish, an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that is used to validate the Android platform virtually (i.e. without a separate device). This is something that is really cool because it makes it easy to follow along with upstream Android development and see what changes they are making under the hood, all from adb shell.</description>

      <description>Recently, I built a computer for school that I installed Windows 10 Pro on (link to the current specs if you are curious). I was a little bummed about leaving Chrome OS because I was going to lose my local Linux development environment; however, Windows Subsystem for Linux is a thing and it has gotten even better with WSL 2, as it is actually running a Linux kernel so there is full Linux compatibility going forward.</description>
