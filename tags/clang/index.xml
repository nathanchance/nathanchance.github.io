      <title>Reducing an LTO Linux kernel bug with cvise</title>

      <description>My co-maintainer Nick Desaulniers wrote a great post about taking a several thousand line C file that exposed a compiler bug down to 12 lines with creduce. I thought I would do the same thing with a bug that only happens with link time optimization (LTO) in the Linux kernel, which is a bit of a different beast. Hopefully this post can help others reduce their own bugs and think about the best way to triage a bug.</description>

      <description>Recently, I stumbled upon a talk that Alistair Delva, a Google engineer, gave at the 2018 Linux Plumbers Conference around Cuttlefish, an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that is used to validate the Android platform virtually (i.e. without a separate device). This is something that is really cool because it makes it easy to follow along with upstream Android development and see what changes they are making under the hood, all from adb shell.</description>

      <title>Building the WSL 2 kernel with Clang</title>

      <description>Recently, I built a computer for school that I installed Windows 10 Pro on (link to the current specs if you are curious). I was a little bummed about leaving Chrome OS because I was going to lose my local Linux development environment; however, Windows Subsystem for Linux is a thing and it has gotten even better with WSL 2, as it is actually running a Linux kernel so there is full Linux compatibility going forward.</description>
