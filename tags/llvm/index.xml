      <title>Reducing an LTO Linux kernel bug with cvise</title>

      <description>My co-maintainer Nick Desaulniers wrote a great post about taking a several thousand line C file that exposed a compiler bug down to 12 lines with creduce. I thought I would do the same thing with a bug that only happens with link time optimization (LTO) in the Linux kernel, which is a bit of a different beast. Hopefully this post can help others reduce their own bugs and think about the best way to triage a bug.</description>

      <description>Before Google+ shut down, I had a post on there giving a brief overview of git bisect, which a lot of people found useful. Unfortunately, I forgot to save it and move it somewhere else before the shutdown deadline. As a result, I am going to redo it here and spice it up a bit.
One caveat before I start: there is great official documentation for git bisect, from which I have taken quite a bit of information.</description>
