      <description>Before Google+ shut down, I had a post on there giving a brief overview of git bisect, which a lot of people found useful. Unfortunately, I forgot to save it and move it somewhere else before the shutdown deadline. As a result, I am going to redo it here and spice it up a bit.
One caveat before I start: there is great official documentation for git bisect, from which I have taken quite a bit of information.</description>

      <description>I have always loved reading good commit messages and I have tried myself to write good commit messages to inspire others to do the same. I see good commit messages as important for two reasons: it allows people who work on a project afterwards to understand the context behind a change (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a denvercoder9 situation) and it allows other people to get familiar with your project by fully understanding the why behind a change.</description>
