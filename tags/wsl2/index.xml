      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a big fan of Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 as I need Windows for school but I am so used to the command line for remoting into my server and automating various tasks locally. For those of you who do not know, WSL 2 uses a Linux kernel under the hood (which I customize &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nathanchance/WSL2-Linux-Kernel&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and all of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distros&#34;&gt;the various distributions&lt;/a&gt; that you can run are basically containers on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I built a computer for school that I installed Windows 10 Pro on (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pcpartpicker.com/user/nchancellor/saved/bLjTCJ&#34;&gt;link to the current specs&lt;/a&gt; if you are curious). I was a little bummed about leaving Chrome OS because I was going to lose my local Linux development environment; however, Windows Subsystem for Linux is a thing and it has gotten even better with WSL 2, as it is actually running a Linux kernel so there is full Linux compatibility going forward. I also learned that it is possible to replace the Linux kernel that Microsoft ships with your own. This is a mini guide for what I uncovered because there is not a ton of information around for how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
