The kernel needs to build in order to be run :)\nALSA: hwdep: Move put_user() call out of scoped_guard() in snd_hwdep_control_ioctl() (v1) hexagon: vmlinux.lds.S: Handle attributes section (v1) Downstream fixes: These are fixes and improvements that occur in a downstream Linux tree, such as Android or ChromeOS, which our continuous integration regularly tests.\nANDROID: usb: gadget: f_midi: Add missing stub for android_clear_midi_device_info() Miscellaneous fixes and improvements: These are fixes and improvements that don’t fit into a particular category but are important to ClangBuiltLinux.\nDocumentation/llvm: Note s390 LLVM=1 support with LLVM 18.1.0 and newer (v1) Warning fixes: These are patches to fix various warnings that appear with LLVM. I used to go into detail about the different warnings and what they mean, but the important takeaway for this section is that the kernel should build warning free, as all developers should be using CONFIG_WERROR, which will turn these all into failures. Maybe these should be in the build failures section…\nPCI: imx6: Fix clang -Wimplicit-fallthrough in imx6_pcie_probe() (v1) kbuild: Move -Wenum-{compare-conditional,enum-conversion} into W=1 (v1, v2) media: mxl5xx: Move xpt structures off stack (v2) clk: qcom: Fix two driver Kconfig dependencies (v1) tracing: Fully silence instance of -Wstring-compare (v1) usb: typec: ptn36502: Only select DRM_AUX_BRIDGE with OF (v1) drm/panthor: Fix clang -Wunused-but-set-variable in tick_ctx_apply() (v1) Patch review and input For the next sections, I link directly to my first response in the thread when possible but there are times where the link is to the main post. My responses can be seen inline by going to the bottom of the thread and clicking on my name.\nReviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.\nRe: [PATCH] kbuild: remove GCC's default -Wpacked-bitfield-compat flag Re: [PATCH] printk: fix _entry_ptr build warning Re: [PATCH] ssb: use \"break\" on default case to prevent warning Re: [PATCH] tracing: Use strcmp() in __assign_str() WARN_ON() check Re: [PATCH 5.15 45/76] modpost: Add '.ltext' and '.ltext.*' to TEXT_SECTIONS Re: [PATCH] memtest: use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE in memory scanning Re: [PATCH-next] arm: fix clang build warning in include/asm/memory.h Re: [PATCH V2] kbuild: rpm-pkg: add dtb files in kernel rpm Re: [tip: x86/percpu] x86/percpu: Convert this_percpu_xchg_op() from asm() to C code, to generate better code Re: [PATCH] scripts/package: buildtar: Output as vmlinuz for riscv Split -Wcast-function-type into a separate group Re: [PATCH 5/9] surface3_power: avoid format string truncation warning Re: [PATCH] ARM: vfp: use asm volatile for FP control register accesses Re: [PATCH v2] arm: fix clang build warning in include/asm/memory.h Issue triage, input, and reporting The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.\nAllow using Hexagon with kernel.org LLVM [MachineFrameInfo] Refactoring with computeMaxcallFrameSize() (NFC) Turn 'counted_by' into a type attribute and parse it into 'CountAttributedType' Re: [RESEND v3 2/2] drm: Add CONFIG_DRM_WERROR Re: [PATCH 3/3] mm: move follow_phys to arch/x86/mm/pat/memtype.c Re: [PATCH v6 10/14] drm/panthor: Add the scheduler logical block function with error attribute not eliminated after commit 3589cacfa8da8 [IR] Add nowrap flags for trunc instruction Tooling improvements These are changes to various tools that we use, such as our continuous integration setup, booting utilities, toolchain building scripts, or other closely related projects such as AOSP’s distribution of LLVM and TuxMake.\ngenerator: workflow: Use setup-python action in check cache stage Fix Python dependency installation in clang-nightly containers Switch s390 builds on -next with LLVM 18 over to LLVM=1 Update patches (March 5, 2024) patches: Drop 6.1 AMDGPU patch from upstream Fix clang-android builds tc_build: tools: Update location of LLVM_VERSION_MAJOR Switch s390 builds on mainline with LLVM 18+ over to LLVM=1 Update stable anchor to 6.8 Update patches (March 15, 2024) patches: mainline: Drop powerpc '-mhard-float' patch Disable MIPS builds that use GNU ld Add patches to fix performing PGO with current LLVM main Update korg-clang-18 to 18.1.2 patches: mainline: Drop -Wenum-enum-conversion patch Enable RISC-V LTO builds on mainline Update patches (March 26, 2024) Behind the scenes Every day that there is a new linux-next release, I rebase and build a few different kernel trees then boot and runtime test them on several different machines, including a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 3, a SolidRun Honeycomb LX2, an Ampere Altra Developer Platform, an Intel-based desktop, an AMD-based desktop, and an Intel-based laptop. This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.\nI ran the March 6th and March 20th ClangBuiltLinux meetings.\nI continue to upload prebuilt, fast versions of LLVM for kernel developers and our continuous integration to use.\n18.1.0 18.1.1 18.1.2 Special thanks Special thanks to Google and the Linux Foundation for sponsoring my work.\n",

<p>Reviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.</p>

<p>Every day that there is a new <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/">linux-next</a> release, I rebase and build a few different kernel trees then boot and runtime test them on several different machines, including a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 3, a SolidRun Honeycomb LX2, an Ampere Altra Developer Platform, an Intel-based desktop, an AMD-based desktop, and an Intel-based laptop. This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.</p>

<li>
<p>I ran the <a href="https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/meeting-notes/pull/56">March 6th</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/meeting-notes/pull/57">March 20th</a> ClangBuiltLinux meetings.</p>
