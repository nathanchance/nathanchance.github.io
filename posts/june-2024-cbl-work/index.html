The kernel needs to build in order to be run :)\npinctrl: keembay: Fix func conversion in keembay_build_functions() (v1) phy: freescale: imx8qm-hsio: Include bitfield.h for FIELD_PREP (v1) Downstream fixes: These are fixes and improvements that occur in a downstream Linux tree, such as Android or ChromeOS, which our continuous integration regularly tests.\nANDROID: arm64: Place CFI jump table sections in .text Stable backports and fixes: It is important to make sure that the stable trees are as free from issues as possible, as those are the trees that devices and users use; for example, Android and Chrome OS regularly merge from stable, so if there is a problem that will impact those trees that we fixed in mainline, it should be backported.\nkbuild: Remove support for Clang's ThinLTO caching (6.1, 5.15) Warning fixes: These are patches to fix various warnings that appear with LLVM. I used to go into detail about the different warnings and what they mean, but the important takeaway for this section is that the kernel should build warning free, as all developers should be using CONFIG_WERROR, which will turn these all into failures. Maybe these should be in the build failures section…\nhostfs: Add const qualifier to host_root in hostfs_fill_super() (v1) drm/amd/display: Disable CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_FP for RISC-V with clang (v1) drm/omap: Restrict compile testing to PAGE_SIZE less than 64KB (v1) Patch review and input For the next sections, I link directly to my first response in the thread when possible but there are times where the link is to the main post. My responses can be seen inline by going to the bottom of the thread and clicking on my name.\nReviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.\nRe: [PATCH] usr: shorten cmd_initfs in Makefile Re: [PATCH] drm/amd/display: Increase frame-larger-than warning limit Re: [PATCH v2 2/2] selftests/lib.mk: silence some clang warnings that gcc already ignores Re: [PATCH v2 1/2] selftests/openat2: fix clang build failures: -static-libasan, LOCAL_HDRS Re: [PATCH v2 2/2] selftests/fchmodat2: fix clang build failure due to -static-libasan Re: [PATCH v2 1/2] selftests/lib.mk: handle both LLVM=1 and CC=clang builds Re: [PATCH] efi: Add missing __nocfi annotations to runtime wrappers Re: [PATCH] arch: um: rust: Add i386 support for Rust Re: [PATCH] selftests/timers: Guard LONG_MAX / LONG_MIN defines Re: [PATCH v3] drm/msm/a6xx: use __unused__ to fix compiler warnings for gen7_* includes Re: [PATCH -next v2] kbuild: explicitly run mksysmap as sed script from link-vmlinux.sh Re: [PATCH] powerpc: vdso: fix building with wrong-endian toolchain Re: [PATCH] media: c8sectpfe: Add missing parameter names Re: [PATCH] kunit/overflow: Adjust for __counted_by with DEFINE_RAW_FLEX() Re: [PATCH 6/7] arm64: start using 'asm goto' for put_user() when available Re: [PATCH] kbuild: move init/build-version to scripts/ Re: [PATCH] modpost: Enable section warning from *driver to .exit.text Re: [PATCH 1/2] kbuild: rpm-pkg: make sure to have versioned 'Obsoletes' for kernel.spec Re: [PATCH 4/8] riscv: ftrace: align patchable functions to 4 Byte boundary Re: [PATCH 3/8] riscv: ftrace: support fastcc in Clang for WITH_ARGS Re: [PATCHv8 bpf-next 3/9] uprobe: Add uretprobe syscall to speed up return probe Re: [PATCH] USB: serial: garmin_gps: annotate struct garmin_packet with __counted_by Re: [PATCH] sparc/build: Make all compiler flags also clang-compatible Re: [PATCH v2] kbuild: rpm-pkg: fix build error with CONFIG_MODULES=n Re: [PATCH] kbuild: deb-dpkg: Check optional env variables before use Re: [PATCH v2] of: reserved_mem: Restructure code to call reserved mem init functions earlier Issue triage, input, and reporting The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.\nBoot issue on arm64 and loongarch after LLVM commit 5c214eb0c628c874f2c9496e663be4067e64442a Re: [PATCH] loongarch: Only select HAVE_OBJTOOL and allow ORC unwinder if the inline assembler supports R_LARCH_{32,64}_PCREL Re: [linux-next:master 1323/3381] drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_gfx.c:333:4: error: format specifies type 'unsigned char' but the argument has type 'int' Re: [Bug] Failing kunit test on ARCH=arm and LLVM=1 Re: [viro-vfs:work.fd 11/19] fs/select.c:860:3: error: cannot jump from this goto statement to its label Re: [PATCH 3/9] x86/fpu: Make task_struct::thread constant size Re: [PATCH v6 1/4] of: reserved_mem: Restruture how the reserved memory regions are processed Re: [PATCH v4 2/2] media: i2c: Add imx283 camera sensor driver Re: ANNOUNCE: pahole v1.27 (reproducible builds, BTF kfuncs) Re: [PATCH 5.10 000/317] 5.10.219-rc1 review [llvm][CodeGen] Add a new software pipeliner 'Window Scheduler' Re: mips allmodconfig build error with llvm-18.1.7-x86_64 Re: [PATCH v16 9/9] drm/i915: Compute CMRR and calculate vtotal Big compile time regression for Hexagon Linux kernel build after commit 90ba33099c Re: mm: huge_memory.c:2736:31: error: variable 'page' is uninitialized when used here Re: arch/arm/mm/proc.c:82:6: error: conflicting types for 'cpu_arm920_reset' Tooling improvements These are changes to various tools that we use, such as our continuous integration setup, booting utilities, toolchain building scripts, or other closely related projects such as AOSP’s distribution of LLVM and TuxMake.\nUpdate patches (June 13, 2024) patches: stable: Drop xpt patch patches: mainline: Drop merged __counted_by patches Behind the scenes Every day that there is a new linux-next release, I rebase and build a few different kernel trees then boot and runtime test them on several different machines, including a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 3, a SolidRun Honeycomb LX2, an Ampere Altra Developer Platform, two Intel-based desktops, an AMD-based desktop, and an Intel-based laptop. This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.\nI continue to upload prebuilt, fast versions of LLVM for kernel developers and our continuous integration to use.\n18.1.7 18.1.8 I ran the June 12 and June 26 ClangBuiltLinux meetings.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Google and the Linux Foundation for sponsoring my work.\n",

<p>For the next sections, I link directly to my first response in the thread when possible but there are times where the link is to the main post. My responses can be seen inline by going to the bottom of the thread and clicking on my name.</p>
<p>Reviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.</p>

<p>Every day that there is a new <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/">linux-next</a> release, I rebase and build a few different kernel trees then boot and runtime test them on several different machines, including a Raspberry Pi 4, a Raspberry Pi 3, a SolidRun Honeycomb LX2, an Ampere Altra Developer Platform, two Intel-based desktops, an AMD-based desktop, and an Intel-based laptop. This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.</p>
