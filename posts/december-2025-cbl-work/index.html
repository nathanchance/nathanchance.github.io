I used to go into detail about the different warnings and what they mean, but the important takeaway for this section is that the kernel should build warning free, as all developers should be using CONFIG_WERROR, which will turn these all into failures. Maybe these should be in the build failures section…\nvirt: Fix Kconfig warning when selecting TSM without VIRT_DRIVERS (v1) ALSA: hda: cix-ipbloq: Use modern PM ops (v1) drm/amd/display: Apply e4479aecf658 to dml (v1) drm/amd/display: Address -Wframe-larger-than with clang-22 (v1) ASoC: rt1320: Change return type of rt1320_t0_load() to void (v1) Patch review and input For the next sections, I link directly to my first response in the thread when possible but there are times where the link is to the main post. My responses can be seen inline by going to the bottom of the thread and clicking on my name.\nReviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.\nRe: [PATCH] kbuild: Add top-level target for building gen_init_cpio Re: [PATCH 1/2] fortify: Rename temporary file to match ignore pattern Re: [PATCH 2/2] fortify: Cleanup temp file also on non-successful exit Re: [PATCH v2] kbuild: fix compilation of dtb specified on command-line without make rule Re: [PATCH v3] mcb: Add missing modpost build support Re: [PATCH 4/4] build: rust: provide an option to inline C helpers into Rust Re: [PATCH] ASoC: codecs: nau8325: Silence uninitialized variables warnings Re: [PATCH v5 0/2] kbuild: distributed build support for Clang ThinLTO Re: [PATCH 6.1.y RESEND] KVM: arm64: silence -Wuninitialized-const-pointer warning Re: [PATCH v2] Support conditional deps using \"depends on X if Y\" Re: [PATCH iwlwifi-fixes] wifi: iwlwifi: Implement settime64 as stub for MVM/MLD PTP Re: Patch \"dma-mapping: Allow use of DMA_BIT_MASK(64) in global scope\" has been added to the 6.17-stable tree Re: [PATCH 6.18 regression fix] dma-mapping: Fix DMA_BIT_MASK() macro being broken Re: [PATCH] kbuild: fix modules.builtin.modinfo being executable Re: [PATCH] modpost: drop '*_probe' from section check whitelist Re: [PATCH] Revert \"scripts/clang-tools: Handle included .c files in gen_compile_commands\" Re: [PATCH v3] kconfig: Support conditional deps using \"depends on X if Y\" Re: [PATCH 1/1] kbuild: Only enable -Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare for W=2 Re: [PATCH v3 0/1] kconfig: move XPM icons to separate files Re: [PATCH v1 1/2] scripts: add tool to run containerized builds Re: [PATCH] kbuild: prefer ${NM} in check-function-names.sh Re: [PATCH v2 1/2] scripts: add tool to run containerized builds Re: [PATCH] kbuild: Add top-level target for building gen_init_cpio Re: [PATCH v2] wifi: mt76: Fix strscpy buffer overflow in mt76_connac2_load_patch Re: [PATCH] riscv: boot: Always make Image from vmlinux, not vmlinux.unstripped Re: [PATCH] kbuild: uapi: Drop check_config() Re: [PATCH 0/5] kbuild: uapi: improvements to header testing Re: [PATCH 1/3] scripts: kconfig: merge_config.sh: refactor from shell/sed/grep to awk Issue triage, input, and reporting The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.\nRe: [linux-next:master 11929/12398] sound/soc/codecs/nau8325.c:430:13: warning: variable 'n2_max' is uninitialized when used here Re: [PATCH v6 11/30] objtool: Trace instruction state changes during function validation Re: [PATCH net-next v1] r8169: add DASH support for RTL8127AP objtool: drivers/media/pci/solo6x10/solo6x10.o: tw28_set_ctrl_val() falls through to next function __cfi_tw28_get_ctrl_val() Re: [PATCH v2 1/8] drivers/virt: Drop VIRT_DRIVERS build dependency [Hexagon] Passes for widening vector operations and shuffle opt [clang] Limit lifetimes of temporaries to the full expression Re: [Linaro-TCWG-CI] v6.18-rc6-688-gcd41d3420ef6: Failure on arm [llvm][clang] Enable IO sandbox for assert builds Re: [bug report] clk: visconti: Add support common clock driver and reset driver Re: [PATCH v3 1/2] drm/xe/xe_survivability: Redesign survivability mode Re: [PATCH v7 0/4] Add support for clean shutdown with MSHV Re: [linux-next:master 9676/10599] ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: rust_build_error Re: error: implicit declaration of function ‘rq_modified_clear’ (was [PATCH 5/5] sched: Rework sched_class::wakeup_preempt() and rq_modified_*()) Re: [GIT PULL] kbuild changes for v6.19 Re: ARMv7 Linux + Rust doesn't boot when compiling with only LLVM=1 Re: Do we still care about compilers without __seg_fs and __seg_gs support??

This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.\nI continue to upload prebuilt, fast versions of LLVM for kernel developers and our continuous integration to use.\n21.1.7 21.1.8 I attended Linux Plumbers 2025 in Tokyo, having good conversations with folks around Kbuild and ClangBuiltLinux.\nSpecial thanks Special thanks to Google and the Linux Foundation for sponsoring my work.\n",

<p>For the next sections, I link directly to my first response in the thread when possible but there are times where the link is to the main post. My responses can be seen inline by going to the bottom of the thread and clicking on my name.</p>
<p>Reviewing patches that are submitted is incredibly important, as it helps ensure good code quality due to catching mistakes before the patches get accepted and it can help get patches accepted faster, as some maintainers will blindly pick up patches that have been reviewed by someone that they trust.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about working at the intersection of two projects is we will often find bugs that are not strictly related to the project, which require some triage and reporting back to the original author of the breakage so that they can be fixed and not impact our own testing. Some of these bugs fall into that category while others are issues strictly related to this project.</p>

<p>Every day that there is a new <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/">linux-next</a> release, I rebase and build a few different kernel trees then boot and runtime test them on several different machines, including a SolidRun Honeycomb LX2, an Ampere Altra Developer Platform, four Intel-based devices, and an AMD-based device. This is not always visible because I do not report anything unless there is something broken but it can take up to a few hours each day, depending on the amount of churn and issues uncovered.</p>
