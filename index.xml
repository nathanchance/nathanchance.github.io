      <description>All of my personal projects can be found on GitHub, here are a few key repositories that I am proud of:
ClangBuiltLinux ClangBuiltLinux is a collaborative organization between several engineers across different companies like Google, Linaro, and IBM to improve building the Linux kernel with the LLVM tools such as clang and lld. I have contributed warning fixes to the mainline Linux kernel, improved the continuous integration setup, and developed a set of toolchain build scripts for myself and others to use for consistent testing/configuration.</description>
