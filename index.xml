      <description>All of my personal projects can be found on GitHub, here are a few key repositories that I am proud of:
ClangBuiltLinux ClangBuiltLinux is a collaborative organization between several engineers across different companies like Google, Linaro, and IBM to improve building the Linux kernel with the LLVM tools such as clang and lld. I have contributed various fixes to the mainline Linux kernel, helped triage and debug issues on the issue tracker, improved the continuous integration setup through a set of scripts and Docker images, and developed a set of toolchain build scripts for myself and others to use for consistent testing/developing.</description>

      <description>I used to host files on this website but I have offloaded them to other services.
Flash Kernel downloads can be found in their individual repos:
 Nexus 6P OnePlus 5 OnePlus 6 Pixel (XL) Pixel 2 (XL)  Note, these are all unmaintained right now so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend running them in their current form but it&amp;rsquo;s your device.
TWRP downloads can be found in the threads that referenced them:</description>
